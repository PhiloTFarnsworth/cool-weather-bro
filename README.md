TODO:

- Build 5 day forecast
- weather alerts (Notifications API?)

- [Open layers](https://openlayers.org/en/latest/apidoc/) maps for 
    - Area selection (Should you not want to share GPS data)
    - Initial loading (You do use GPS, I'm gonna waste 5 seconds of you time zooming in on your pin)
    - Radar (That seems possible)
